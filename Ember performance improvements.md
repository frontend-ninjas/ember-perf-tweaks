# Ember performance improvements

In this collection you will learn tips and tricks on making your Ember apps faster, accessible and perfectly awesome!

# Introduction

## What is Ember?

Ember is an ambitious web framework for ambitious web developers. It is free, opensource and always will be. Here’s a [quickstart to learning Ember](https://emberjs.com/learn). In order to get used to this collection, you should be already familiar with Ember and the ecosystem.

## The ecosystem:

1. Ember CLI: Official command line toolkit for developing Ember apps.
2. Ember Inspector: A browser extension that helps inspect Ember apps.
3. Ember twiddle: Playground for trying out and experimenting with Ember code on the browser.
4. Ember Engines: An addon that allows multiple logical units of Ember apps to be composed together into a single app from the user’s perspective.
5. Fastboot: SSR for Ember apps.
6. Liquid fire: Animation toolkit for Ember apps.
7. Ember observer: Collection of all Ember addons from the community.

## Understanding working on Performance for Ember apps

Key areas to optimize Ember apps:

1. Improving on build size.
2. Improving assets cache.
3. Building and optimising your Ember app for SEO.
4. Improving accessibility of your Ember apps.
5. Making your Ember apps installable.
6. Improving your Ember developer build timelines.

## Building a sample app:

1. To install ember-cli globally, run `npm i -g ember-cli`. To ensure ember-cli is installed, run the command `ember -v`.
2. To create a new ember app, run `ember new <application-name>`. This should create the folder in your application name and add a boilerplate codebase with a minimal folder structure. It would also install the npm packages it needs.
3. Once done, `cd <application-name>` and say `npm start`.
4. You should now be able to access your application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/).
