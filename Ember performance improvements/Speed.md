# Improving on build size and making your builds faster

### Minification, Gzip or Brotli compression and Fingerprinting.

Make sure your builds are done with `production` flag turned on.

    ember b -p
    # or
    ember build --prod
    # or
    ember build --environment=production

First and foremost, like every asset that the appâ€™s index.html consumes, need to be minified and gzippâ€™ed.Â In Ember, your app could be configured to do so using the following lines of code:

    // ember-cli-build.js
    
    module.exports = function(defaults) {
        // ...
        const isProduction = EmberApp.env() === 'production';
        
        let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
          fingerprint: {
            enabled: isProduction // Enabled in production by default until you override.
          },
          minifyJS: {
            enabled: isProduction // Enabled in production by default until you override.
          },
          minifyCSS: {
            enabled: isProduction // Enabled in production by default until you override.
          }
        });
    
        // ...
    
        return app.toTree();
    };

You donâ€™t have to generally worry about this configuration as Ember takes care of it for you for prod builds.

## Analyze bundle size and optimize asset size

`ember-cli-bundle-analyzer` is an Ember CLI addon that analyzes the size and contents of your Ember apps. To try it out check [https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-cli-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-cli-bundle-analyzer)

It helps you to

- Analyze which individual modules make it into your final bundle
- Find out how big each contained module is, including the raw source, minified and gzipped sizes
- Find modules that got there by mistake; and
- Optimize your bundle size

Install this addon using the following command:

    ember install ember-cli-bundle-analyzer

Once done, navigate to [http://localhost:4200/_analyze](http://localhost:4200/_analyz) in your web browser to analyze the output.

## Using dependencies that you only need on boot.

Generally, any npm package that you add, when you use the traditional approach (during the < Ember-2.12 days) of `app.import('node_modules/package/src.js');` in your ember-cli-build.js contributes to increased vendor.js file size. 

For example, if you would want your Ember app to have 3rd party packages like lodash-es, your app needs the code while using some of the lodash methods. Using `[ember-auto-import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import)` you can dynamically import these dependencies code at run time.

Before we get go in depth of this process, let's see our `vendor.js` of the current sample app:

![Speed/Untitled.png](Speed/Untitled.png)

It is at 591Kb

To get started with ember-auto-import:

    npm install --save-dev lodash-es # Adds lodash-es for example to your dependencies
    
    ember install ember-auto-import

And go ahead and say in your components or controllers or any parts of your code.

    import { capitalize } from 'lodash-es';

Wait, vendor.js just got increased by ~200Kb while doing the above steps ðŸ˜±

![Speed/Untitled%201.png](Speed/Untitled%201.png)

Doing just this, shot the file size to 765Kb!

Didn't we say we wanted to reduce the vendor.js size? Yes, for which you need to do a little bit more:

### Welcome Dynamic Import!

Dynamic import is currently a Stage 3 ECMA feature, so to use it there are a few extra setup steps:

1. Install babel-eslint

        npm install --save-dev babel-eslint

2. In your .eslintrc.js file, add

        parser: 'babel-eslint'

3. In your ember-cli-build.js file, enable the babel plugin provided by ember-auto-import:

        let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
          babel: {
            plugins: [ require.resolve('ember-auto-import/babel-plugin') ]
          }
        });

4. Now all you need to do is, just dynamically import the dependency. For example:

        import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
        
        export default class SampleInnerRoute extends Route {
          model() { // This will be render-blocking, you can also move this to your controller' or component' JS file
            return import('lodash-es').then(({ capitalize }) => {
              return capitalize('Sample App');
            });
          }
        }

    Moving to dynamic imports brought it back down to 592Kb.

## Measure Rendering Performance

Ember's ecosystem comes with a Google Chrome Extension and Mozilla Firefox Addon called "Ember Inspector". One of the important features of the Ember Inspector is "Render Performance".
